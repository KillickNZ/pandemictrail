            <h1>Welcome to Pandemic</h1>
            <p>
                Kia Ora fellow MTB athletes! Thanks for venturing out into the wilderness to ride our trail! <br><br>
                Here at Pandemic Head Office, we love getting out in the bush and want to see more trees 
                and more trails around NZ.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've enjoyed this trail and would like more awesome 
                trails through native forest, I'd like to take this opportunity to ask you to give to one 
                of the following charities that are involved with planting forests around NZ.                                                 
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://wrtqt.org.nz/donate/" target="new">The Wakatipu Reforestation Trust</a> is a group of local legends working to restore native biodiversity to the basin.<br> 
                <a href="https://millionmetres.org.nz/projects_search/60/all/all?" target="new">Million Meters</a> is a nationwide organization that focuses on community driven planting projects, a lot of which are riparian planting along water ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if you too enjoy being outdoors in the bush (If you're riding this trail I suspect that you do!) 
                then consider taking a a brief minute before dropping in to ensure that we will have awesome trails to ride in native bush long into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Go on, chuck these legends a buck:<br>
